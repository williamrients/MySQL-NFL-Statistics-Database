# MySQL-NFL-Statistics-Database
This is my final project for Relational Database and SQL which consist of a database for NFL players statistics
## Brief Description
There is a plethora of NFL statistics with some that are more important that other. Sometime trying to find these more important/popular statistics can be hard to find because they are buried in with other statistics. Some of the most important statistics are Touchdown Passes, Receiving Touchdowns, Rushing Touchdowns just to name a few.
## Purpose
- There are so many different NFL statistics that are associated with different positions, teams, seasons, and individual players. A good example is being able to quickly retrieve information on specific player, like how many Touchdowns Passes they threw in a specific season. 
- Players also get traded to teams in the middle of the season, and sometimes even get their position changed or play multiple positions. So being able to see which player is one what team and what position they play is important.
## User Stories
When I use this database, I want to be able to view all players on a team in a season, view all players and their respective position, and view all players stats. Next, I would like to be able to add a new player in a season, with their teamâ€™s name, position, stat, and stat amount. As well as update this data and delete this data. 
## Planned Uses/Goals
This database is meant for personal use but in the future, I would like to create an application/website that can utilize this databases information and display in a helpful way.
